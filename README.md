# VRCFury Extensions - Uhhh

I like VRCFury. I want random stuff in VRCFury for my personal use that doesn't really fit in the actual project. So... this repo is really just for random VRCFury features I whip up in an hour to ~~make~~ avoid more work for myself.

## Project References
You'll need these in your project so they can be references.

- [Unity Mesh Simplifier](https://github.com/Whinarn/UnityMeshSimplifier)
- [Poiyomi (Toon/Pro)](https://github.com/poiyomi/PoiyomiToonShader)

## Features

### Mesh Simplifier
This is essentially just runtime mesh decimation. That's it. Specify a mesh, a quality, and it'll do its thing.

### Lighting Controls
This component will automatically create animations for every mesh on your avatar that adjust various lighting aspects and menu sliders to go along with it. It's mainly meant for poiyomi, but has limited support for lilToon and UCTS.

Your poiyomi materials will be automatically unlocked if a parameter is being animated on them.

Currently has options for 
- Lighting Intensity
- Lighting Greyscale
